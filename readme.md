This is a project from the curriculum of [The Odin Project's Foundation Path](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project).

#### What is The Odin Project?

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about) is a free open source coding curriculum that helps students learn the necessary skills to become a full stack developer from scratch. The curriculum is self-paced and makes use of online resources, such as tutorials, blogs, videos, and official documentation. Students learn from lessons and modules and build portfolio-worthy projects to master their skills in web development.
